This project is my bachelor’s thesis. The goal is to examine the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on household
mortgages and consumer loans during the first year of the pandemic. The study aims to find
whether the amount of household loans in Euro area countries are dependent on the number
of COVID-19 infections and hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Correlation between these variables 
is estimated by four regression models: two versions ordinary least squares regression,
fixed effects regression and random effects regression. The aim is to create a model that
explains high proportion of the variance of the amount of household mortgages and consumer
loans. Multiple control variables which explain the state of country’s economy and the state
of country’s households were included in the model to achieve this goal. The data consists of
information on 19 Euro area countries during 49-week period.
<br><br>
The most suitable estimation method was chosen according to statistical tests. As a result, the
fixed effect regression was chosen. According to fixed effect regression there is a statistically
significant positive correlation between mortgages and COVID-19 infections. The correlation
between consumer loans and infections as well as hospitalized patients is negative but statistically insignificant.
